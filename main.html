    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to ensure faster execution.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is typically expressed using Big-O notation, such as <code>O(n)</code>, where 'n' represents the input size.
