    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Efficient algorithms are characterized by lower time complexity.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory required by an algorithm during its execution. This includes the memory used by variables, constants, and other data structures. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
